    <!-- Part 1 - Photogrpahy vs. other Medium  -->
      <h1> MoMA: Photography Collection</h1>
      <h6> By RC</h6>
      <p> Photography, as a form of fine art, emerges relatively recently compared to traditional mediums like paintings and sculptures. 
        There's an enduring struggle for artistic recognition by photographers throughout the centuries. 
        Only in the mid-19th century did photography begin to be acknowledged as an aesthetic medium, by some.  
        Let's explore what MoMA's photography acquisitions can reveal about the journey of photography as a visual art medium.

      <h2> MoMA’s photography collection overview: Acqusition history  </h2>

      <p> Let's take a look acquisition trends. 
          It appears there's been a very slow growth with a handful of outlier years.
      </p>  
      <img src="./EDA/Acquisition_photog_or_not.png" height="300" > 

      <p>  Let's remove the outlier years (>6,000 artwork acquired) to get a better resolution.
        Between the 70's and the 90's, the acquisition volume hovers around 1,000 per year.
        After the 90's, it jumps between 1,500 and 4,000 per year.
      </p>

      <p>  For photography, the acquisition volume hovers around 200-400 per year.
        After the 90's, it jumps between 500 and 1,300 per year.
      </p>
      <img src="./EDA/acquisition_photog_or_not_outlier_removed.png" height="300" > 


      <p>  As a percentage, photography acquisition is around 30% of all acquistion.
      </p>
      <img src="./EDA/percent_acquired_photog.png" height="300" > 

      <p>  When looking at # of unique artist with work acquired each year, as opposed to number of art work, 
        we see that around 200-600 unique artists have work acquired by MoMA in recent year. 
        For photography, around 50-100 unique artists had MoMA acquired their work since 2010.
